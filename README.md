Free Home Assessment</span><br><br>One of our experienced building scientists will evaluate the basement foundation, potential radon entry points, the sub-slab granular material and how the basement spaces are used to come up with a potential mitigation design that maximises efficiency and minimizes cost. From there we provide you with an estimate and a preferred system design.</div>           

<div class="content_blocktxt stacked" style="padding-left:0;padding-right:0"><span class="h3"></span><span class="h3">2. Mitigation Diagnostics</span><br><br>This is where the science happens and this is what sets us apart.  Using specialized tools and detailed pressure measurements we follow a specific  Health Canada process to demonstrate that our design is engineered to protect the entire foundation.

Mitigation Installation</span><br><br>This is where we install the mitigation system in your home.  We'll vent the system outside of your home, and complete the piping, bracing, fan installation, sealing, system monitor and labelling. Once everything is installed we will perform another pressure test to make sure the entire system is effectively treating the entire foundation.</div>         </div>       </div>
